Working on /pages/temp 
Inserting all the text.
The sections have got substantially trimmed, so the original boxes are looking overblown. Also the headings are very large.
So I'm writing a new set of classes for these sections:

.home_text     - width
.home_text h1  - heading size and colour

I'm hoping .home_text will work with a single column for each section.

I removed the .home_domain h1 style as it is exactly what I'm wanting in the new style.

I'm building up the pages/temp page by putting all the final text in their own divs to see if they fit and look ok - we'll add the graphical elements, and dynamic effects later.

I'm putting a left border on the divs so that I can be sure I'm seeing them.

The bottom questions in the domain areas look too cramped in the bullet points - they should be more or less a single line. I'm adding a class in home_domain as col450 to give a 450 width.

I'm rationialising the classes for .home_text boxes - so that I can have narrow and wide paras.

Having got all the static text in place, I'm looking at generic animation.

First, I am putting a closeIt x at the top right of each text box. 
It wants to be an x and to change colour on hover.
I'm borrowing the style from the one used many times, taking it from my push_reveal class and putting it under the home_text class.
The x box is not sitting on the right margin of the div containing it.
I changed all the links from <a> tags to <div> - I know there might be an old browser issue, but hopefully very old...
I've put them in all the text boxes.

Now I want clicking the x box to close the div.
It is the parent div, so I hope the .parent property will work to id the target in jquery.
Working in twscripts.
That seems to work without a problem - it closes the <div> (I learned you have to use .parent() not just .parent)

Now I want a system to open each <div>. I'm thinking I could use an #id based system, or a .next
I think I will try for a next based approach - next(".home_text")

I used (this).parent().next()
It works fine, but not with the closeIt <div> - i've set it with .animate({width:'toggle'}, 500) and that is fine, but the close is not clean - it leaves the closeIt div hanging on the left.
So for this round I'm going to remove the x boxes, and leave the <div> to both open and close.
I'll set all the display in .home_text to none.
Done. 
I've changed all the placeholder graphics to be a bit more lookable...

Last thing today, I just want to animate the box to line up at the left when opened.

Working with tim gs today, we are going for the quickest possible pathway to Getting It Done.
Going for a layout for each domain area that has links to 3 case studies.
I've laid them out, and uploading to git/heroku

Working on /pages/temp 
Inserting all the text.
The sections have got substantially trimmed, so the original boxes are looking overblown. Also the headings are very large.
So I'm writing a new set of classes for these sections:

.home_text     - width
.home_text h1  - heading size and colour

I'm hoping .home_text will work with a single column for each section.

I removed the .home_domain h1 style as it is exactly what I'm wanting in the new style.

I'm building up the pages/temp page by putting all the final text in their own divs to see if they fit and look ok - we'll add the graphical elements, and dynamic effects later.

I'm putting a left border on the divs so that I can be sure I'm seeing them.

The bottom questions in the domain areas look too cramped in the bullet points - they should be more or less a single line. I'm adding a class in home_domain as col450 to give a 450 width.

I'm rationialising the classes for .home_text boxes - so that I can have narrow and wide paras.

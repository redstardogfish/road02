	  <p>A client in the infrastructure industry wanted to make strategic choices about how it positioned itself for the future. It was willing to make bold changes to its business model, or to move into new geographies or new kinds of value offering. But how to be wise about those choices? How to be strategic in the face of a turbulent future where societal trends might open up great possibilities, or close others down entirely?</p>

	  <p>Second Road created an immersive environment for the executive team - a ‘strategy lab’ - helping them to project their image of their business into the industry landscape of the decades to come. It was not a matter of making brittle predictions, but rather of identifying industry, natural and social forces which would inevitably play a part in shaping the environment in which they could play.</p>

      <p>By visualising future possibilities and applying powerful heuristics for choosing strategic options, the executive group set bold direction for their organisation over immediate and long term horizons.</p>

	  <p>A company in the telecommunications industry had set itself a challenging growth target - growth that would need to come from radical strategy. They had identified potentially lucrative new markets, but the current management mindset tended to stick with business as it had been in the past. The company also knew that it faced the challenge of building new capability among its people at the same time as it initiated work to take hold of new opportunities.</p>

	  <p>Second Road helped the company to discover entirely new sources of revenue - unearthing new value in emerging markets. These new directions would also challenge the business to evolve its fundamental business model.</p>

      <p>	We also helped them to frame their propositions in a way that would allow more cautious managers to understand the opportunity and to buy into it as it developed and strengthened. The framework brought together possible new markets, new sectors and new clients, crystallised in new compelling value propositions. The process of strategic innovation helped move managers from ambiguous situation to reliable new business.</p>

	  <p>The leadership group in a large insurance company could see the enormous untapped potential within its existing workforce. The challenge was at the level of the organisation’s culture, which preferred tried and tested ways of working, rather than looking for creativity and rewarding innovative proposals. It did not want to start an specialised department for innovation - an ‘innovation ghetto’ - rather it wanted ‘design thinking’ to be a hallmark of work throughout the business.</p>

	  <p>With our client we designed a development program to introduce staff throughout the organisation to design thinking. The aim was to build design awareness and capability among regular staff, rather than specialists. Centred on a suite of Second Road Thinking Technologies™, groups were introduced to the principles of design thinking, and given the opportunity to apply them to their work environment.</p>

	  <p>A large public vocational education institute felt that if meandered on the way it was going, it would soon lose relevance to both young people looking to enter the workforce, and to the government, its main source of funding. They needed to take action, and thinking about how they were relevant to its various stakeholders seemed a good place to start.</p>

	  <p>This was the first step on a long and surprising journey with Second Road. Rather than treating students as simply an external stakeholder or customer, we helped them to enter richly into the outlook and experience of their potential customers. A deep identification with the point of view of these crucial users of the education services led the institute to fundamentally rethink its values, objectives and working models. This in turn led to a transformation of its basic stance as a player in the relationships between a new workforce, employers and government.</p>

	  <p>The board of a public company client would regularly receive a risk report, carefully collated from all the activities of five diverse business units. No stone went unturned, or so it would seem - all was bound up in an inch thick document. Unfortunately, the clear and present business-threatening was half way down page 324. And the cluster of risks that weren’t a part of present operations - including regional market shifts and potential pressure from finance bodies - didn’t feature at all. For all its worthy detail, the document was worse than useless for a board member.</p>

	  <p>Second Road worked with the board to ask the right questions of the business. This began a transformation in the way that information was passed between the operation and its governing body. A new genre of document - the Top Down Report™ - became the focus of board conversation. These reports answered all of the key questions on a single page, backed up by detail that a reader could dive into at their leisure and quickly locate the detail they sought.</p>

	  <p>	A client was involved in a very large infrastructure project for State Government - designing and building a large number of new assets. Progress had ground to a halt, caught in a back and forth game of quibbling about clauses in contract documentation. Engineers would argue the toss about the intention of many design details, with no prospect for actually agreeing to a design specification, let alone a built product.</p>

	  <p>Fundamentally we helped the parties to talk together productively. We created new objects of conversation, centered not on points of contention, but rather on their shared aspiration for designing infrastructure which would serve the community over the decades to come. For the first time, the parties shared a concern for the progress of the project overall, and worked together to advance the design process in record time.</p>

  <h1>	What is the 'second road'?</h1>
  <div class="col450">
	<p>The Western world, from Aristotle onwards, has sought truth and direction along two different paths:</p> 
	<ul>
	  <li>a first road represented by the principles of logic, the engine room of analysis and analytic inquiry</li>
	  <li>a second road constituted by the principles of rhetoric - persuasive argument, intent, invention and socialisation.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Aristotle’s opinion was that the first road is most suitable for answering questions of science and nature, the second for managing human nature and civic affairs.</p> 	
	<p>Both roads are powerful. Both yield insights. Both are necessary.</p> 
	<p>Our business world today, however, is not what it was a century, or even a decade ago. Interconnectedness, velocity, volatile change and the critical importance of people make it impossible to simply ‘make a plan and stick to it’. Logic and analysis alone are not enough to prepare an organisation for a future in a shifting, global environment.</p> 
	<p>Business leaders today need the second road - the path of invention and design - to envision compelling yet flexible strategy, create common purpose and mobilise people into action. They need new skills derived from the arts of design, language and storytelling.</p> 
	<p>Second Road is at the forefront of the ‘second road’ today.</p>

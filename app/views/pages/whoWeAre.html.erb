    <p><strong>Design and Language are the life force that defines
Second Road.</strong></p>

    <p>The deliberate fusion of these two distinct yet complementary
systems acts as a catalyst to <span>liberate creative thinking and
cohere diverse communities.</span></p>

    <p>Avoiding complexity is not an option for leaders today.
Complexity is the landscape - the challenge is how to respond.
Second Road relishes big, wicked problems. Our whole-of-system
approach harnesses the ambiguous forces that often frustrate our
clients. At the core of our approach is the art and science that
reside in design and language. We use these elements to <span>carve
creative, pragmatic pathways through complexity.</span></p>

    <p>The genius of language is its ability to unlock meaning, create
clarity and convey relevance in both written and verbal
communication.</p>

    <p>The elegance of design is its capacity to discover, invent and
prototype with end users front and centre.</p>

    <p>Together, language and design <span>transform complexity into
opportunity</span>.</p>

	<h1>The Second Road Story</h1> 
    <p>What is the “second road”?</p>


    <p>Aristotle believed in two roads to truth, according to Second
Road founder Tony Golsby Smith. The <span>first road</span>
followed the path of logic using an analytical mode of inquiry. The
<span>second road</span> offered an alternative path of rhetoric,
intent and invention. The first road is suitable for questions of
science, the second for exploring human interactions.</p>

    <p>Fast-forward two millennia. The western world of management
chose the first road during the 19<span>th</span> and
20<span>th</span> centuries to address burgeoning
industrialisation. Scalability, predictability and reliability were
attainable goals of the time.</p>

    <p><span>Today, the business world is a much different
place.</span> Volatile change makes it impossible to simply 'make a
plan and stick to it'. Logic and analysis alone are not enough to
prepare an organization for a future in a shifting, global
environment.</p>



    <p>Business leaders looking for a better way to <span>envision
compelling yet flexible strategy, create common purpose and
mobilize people to action</span> need new skills derived from
design and language. The time has come to discover the second
road.</p>
